The `NestedParamsSolution.jsx` shows how to resolve the issue. The solution uses prop drilling: the route parameters are passed down as props through the parent components to the `Grandchild` component.  Alternatively, you could use React Context API for a more scalable solution for more deeply nested components.  Note that Context API is not provided in this example but is an equally viable alternative.
