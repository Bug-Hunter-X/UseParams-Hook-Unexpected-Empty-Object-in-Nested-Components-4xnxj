In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly a child of a route that matches the params can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `params` object might be empty or undefined because the hook only works within the route scope where params are defined. This often happens when you try accessing parameters from deeply nested components or components accessed indirectly through other components.
